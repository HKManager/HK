/* SOUND MANAGER ***************************************************************
Load sound effects and play them when they are done. Note that the sound manager
does not load the sounds until they are actually played and I don't know a way
around this. I would have liked to integrate sounds with the asset manager, but
the audio element does not appear to work in the same way as the image element,
so the program waits forever at startup for audio elements to load that will
never load. Anyway, since it's best to have a simple interface to play sounds
a dedicated sound manager seems like a sensible plan.

Music was hacked in in 10 minutes late at night. Might be worth checking the code...
