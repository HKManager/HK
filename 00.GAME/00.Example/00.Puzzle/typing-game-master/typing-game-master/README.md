===========

Front-end exercise:

Use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to create a simple typing game.

Requirements:

 • Random letters appear in a containing <div> element, 1000px wide, at an interval of 1 second.

 • Every 100 milliseconds, all the existing letters move right by 10px.

 • Pressing a correct letter removes the oldest instance of that letter, and increases the score by 1 

point.

 • Pressing a letter that isn't on the page decreases the score by 1 point.

 • Pressing Escape ends the game.

 • If a letter gets all the way to the right-hand side of the container, the game is over.

 • For every 20 letters that have been found, the interval of letter creation decreases by 10%.

Tools:

 • Use any JavaScript libraries you like.

 • Provide a single HTML file and your supporting .js and .css files.

 • If you use a CSS preprocessor (SASS, LESS, etc.) please include your source files also.
