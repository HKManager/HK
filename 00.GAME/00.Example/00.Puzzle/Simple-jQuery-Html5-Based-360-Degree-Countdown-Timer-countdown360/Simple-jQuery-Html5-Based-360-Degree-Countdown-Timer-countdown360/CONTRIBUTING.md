# Contributing

Before sending a pull request remember to follow [jQuery Core Style Guide](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/).

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Make your changes on the `src` folder, never on the `dist` folder.
4. Do not change `countdown360.jquery.json`. Make sure you don't commit a mess of whitespace only changes. Please only include the actual functional code changes, not style changes.
5. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some feature'`
6. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
7. Submit a pull request :smiley:
