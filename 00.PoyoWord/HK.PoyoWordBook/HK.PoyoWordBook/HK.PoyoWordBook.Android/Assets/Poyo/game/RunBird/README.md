## Sharing is Caring <3

Some tricks and tips that we learnt while making this game has been
shared on [CodeTheory](http://codetheory.in) and
[CSSDeck](http://cssdeck.com/codecasts).

## Game Libraries Used

No Gaming/Physics Libraries/Frameworks used. All Custom Code and Custom Physics.
Only jQuery used for quick and few DOM manipulations.

## About

Based on the compo's rules, the concepts
that we tried to incorporate are fork, branch, push, pull, clone.

You are pappu in the game, a little character. You need to
click the mouse or tap (touch screen) to levitate else
pappu will descend. If he hits the top or bottom boundaries
that'll end the game.

There will be some obstacles along the way like forks, branches
and some enemies who are also known as "pakias". Hitting them
will end the game. 3 types of pakias - sad (pull you),
happy (push you), angry (kill you). Keep safe distance from
them!

There are some collectibles too! Coins for points (yellow for 50,
pink for 100, red for 500, blue for 1000). Stars for invincibility
for a short period. Berries spawning clones that'll destroy
anything that comes in their way!

Collisions are not super strict to make the gameplay a little less harder.

No Libraries/Frameworks used. All Custom Code and Custom Physics.

Hit Enter or Spacebar keys to (re)start the game.
