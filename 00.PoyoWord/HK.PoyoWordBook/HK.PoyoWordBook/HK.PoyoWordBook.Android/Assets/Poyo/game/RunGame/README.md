5. God mode

## Features to be done:

## Misc.

Best performance in Chrome.

Audio cannot play if the next sound clip is activated too fast after the previous one (e.g. try killing monsters in quick succession).

I didn't separate out the files into game.html and game.js. Code quality is not good either. Sorry about that.
