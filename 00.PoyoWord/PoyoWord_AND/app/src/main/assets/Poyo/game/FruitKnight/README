This is Typing Ninja, a fork of Veggie-Knight
(http://jonashw.github.io/Veggie-Knight/) for the 2015 GitHub Game-Off.

Typing Ninja is like Veggie Knight (which is a clone of the popular
fruit-slicing game Fruit Ninja) except that instead of swiping with your
mouse to slice the veggies, you slice them by typing.

Runs in your browser; requires JavaScript and HTML5 (Canvas).
