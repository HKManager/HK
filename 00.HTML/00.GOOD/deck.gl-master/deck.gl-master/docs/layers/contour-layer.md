# ContourLayer

## About

`ContourLayer` renders `Isoline`s or `Isoband`s for a given threshold and cell size. `Isoline` represents collection of line segments that separate the area above and below a given threshold. `Isoband` represents a collection of polygons (filled) that fill the area containing values in a given threshold range. To generate an `Isoline` single threshold value is needed, to generate an `Isoband` an Array with two values needed. Data is first aggregated using given cell size and resulting scalar field is used to run [Marching Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares) algorithm that generates a set of vertices to form Isolines or Isobands. In below documentation `Isoline` and `Isoband` is referred as `contour`.

## Usage

```js
import DeckGL, {ContourLayer} from 'deck.gl';

const App = ({data, viewport}) => {

  /**
   * Data format:
   * [
   *   {COORDINATES: [-122.42177834, 37.78346622]},
   *   ...
   * ]
   */
  const layer = new ContourLayer({
    id: 'contourLayer',
    // Three contours are rendered.
    contours: [
      {threshold: 1, color: [255, 0, 0, 255], strokeWidth: 1}, // => Isoline for threshold 1
      {threshold: 5, color: [0, 255, 0], strokeWidth: 2}, // => Isoline for threshold 5
      {threshold: [6, 10], color: [0, 0, 255, 128]} // => Isoband for threshold range [6, 10)
    ],
    cellSize: 200,
    getPosition: d => d.COORDINATES,
  });

  return (<DeckGL {...viewport} layers={[layer]} />);
};
```

## Properties

Inherits from all [Base Layer](/docs/api-reference/layer.md) properties.

### Render Options

##### `cellSize` (Number, optional)

* Default: `1000`

Size of each cell in meters

##### `gpuAggregation` (bool, optional)

* Default: true

When set to true and browser supports GPU aggregation, aggregation is performed on GPU. GPU aggregation can be 2 to 3 times faster depending upon number of points and number of cells.

NOTE: GPU Aggregation requires WebGL2 support by the browser. When `gpuAggregation` is set to true and browser doesn't support WebGL2, aggregation falls back to CPU.

##### `contours` (Array, optional)

* Default: `[{threshold: 1}]`

Array of objects with following keys

* `threshold` (Number or Array) :

  - Isolines: `threshold` value must be a single `Number`, Isolines are generated based on this threshold value.
  - Isobands: `threshold` value must be an Array of two `Number`s. Isobands are generated using `[threshold[0], threshold[1])` as threshold range, i.e area that has values `>= threshold[0]` and `< threshold[1]` are rendered with corresponding color. NOTE: `threshold[0]` is inclusive and `threshold[1]` is not inclusive.

* `color` (Array, optional) : RGBA color array to be used to render the contour, if not specified a default value of `[255, 255, 255, 255]` is used. When a three component RGB array specified, a default value of 255 is used for Alpha.

* `strokeWidth` (Number, optional) : Applicable for `Isoline`s only, width of the Isoline in pixels, if not specified a default value of `1` is used.

* `zIndex` (Number, optional) : Defines z order of the contour. Contour with higher `zIndex` value is rendered above contours with lower `zIndex` values. When visualizing overlapping contours, `zIndex` along with `zOffset` (defined below) can be used to precisely layout contours. This also avoids z-fighting rendering issues. If not specified a unique value from `0` to `n` (number of contours) is assigned.

##### `zOffset`: (Number, optional)

* Default: `0.005`

A very small z offset that is added for each vertex of a contour (Isoline or Isoband). This is needed to control the layout of contours, especially when rendering overlapping contours. Imagine a case where an Isoline is specified which is overlapped with an Isoband. To make sure the Isoline is visible we need to render this above the Isoband.

##### `fp64` (Boolean, optional)

* Default: `false`

Whether the layer should be rendered in high-precision 64-bit mode. Note that since deck.gl v6.1, the default 32-bit projection uses a hybrid mode that matches 64-bit precision with significantly better performance.

### Data Accessors

##### `getPosition` (Function, optional)

* Default: `object => object.position`

Method called to retrieve the position of each point.

##### `getWeight` (Function, optional)

* Default: `object => 1`

Method called to retrieve weight of each point. By default each point will use a weight of `1`.
