Experimental integration with mapbox-layer API

You need to checkout the `custom-layers` branch in mapbox-gl-js and do a dev-build, and copy `mapbox-gl-dev.js` to this directory before running.

```js
yarn start-local
```

This directory contains two independent examples:
- `app.js`: the pure-js example entry point.
- `react-app.js`: the React example entry point.
