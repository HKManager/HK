# RFC Directory (deck.gl)


## Guidelines

The core developers will review RFCs (and of course, comments from the community are always welcome). Recommended review criteria are being documented in [RFC Review Guidelines](../common/RFC-GUIDELINES.md).


## Roadmaps

Documents indicating intent and direction for bigger areas of functionality. Roadmap documents are intended to provide higher level descriptions than the more detailed, topic-focused RFCs.

Also see luma.gl roadmaps, such as the GPGPU roadmap
