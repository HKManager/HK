## Hello World: Webpack2

Uses [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) to bundle files and serves it
with [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#webpack-dev-server).

Commands:
* `npm start` is the development target, and will serves the app on port 3000.
* `npm run build` is the production target, to create the final bundle.

Remarks:
* In a real application you would likely want to add things like hot reloading for development
   and a minification step etc to the production build step etc.
* These steps have been omitted here in order to keep the example as simple as possible.
