# Using JSON Layers

deck.gl supports specification of deck.gl layers and their props using the [JSON format](https://www.json.org/).

* [JSON Layers RFC](https://github.com/uber/deck.gl/blob/master/dev-docs/RFCs/v6.1/json-layers-rfc.md)


## Schema

The valid combinations are essentially defined by the documented deck.gl API.


## Error Handling

Error detection is currently limited and error messages may not be very helpful.
