# ThirdPersonView Class (Experimental)

The [`ThirdPersonView`] class is a subclass of [View](/docs/api-reference/view.md). This view creates a "camera" in a position that looks **at** an exact position, position using the direction, distance and orientation specified by the application, in contrast with e.g. [FirstPersonView](/docs/api-reference/view.md) that looks out **from** the position specified in the view state.

To render, a `ThirdPersonView` needs to be combined with a `viewState` object with the following parameters:

* `position` (`Number[3]`) - position


A `ThirdPersonView` will work with geospatial coordinate systems if a geospatial "anchor point" is provided in the `viewState` via:

* `longitude`
* `latitude`
* `zoom`

The `position` vector will then be interpreted as meter offsets from this anchor point.

For more information on using `View` classes, consult the [Views](/docs/developer-guide/views.md) article.


## Usage

```js
const view = new ThirdPersonView({
  // Projection parameters (perspective projection)
  fov: 45
});
```


## Constructor

```js
new ThirdPersonView({fov: 45, width: 500, height: 500, ...});
```

`ThirdPersonView` takes the same parameters as the [View](/docs/api-reference/view.md) superclass constructor.

Parameters:

* `opts` (Object) - Third person view options

  projection matrix arguments:

  + `fov` (Number, optional) - Field of view covered by camera. Default to `75`.
  + `near` (Number, optional) - Distance of near clipping plane. Default to `1`.
  + `far` (Number, optional) - Distance of far clipping plane. Default to `100`.
  + `aspect` (Number, optional) - Aspect ratio. Default to the view's `width/height`.

See [View constructor](/docs/api-reference/view.md#constructor) for additional parameters, especially for specifying alternate projection matrices, geospatial anchor etc.


## Methods

Inherits all [View methods](/docs/api-reference/view.md#methods).


## Remarks

* Like all `View`s, the `ThirdPersonView` will work with all geospatial coordinate systems if a geospatial "anchor point" is supplied through the `longitude`, `latitude` and `zoom` options. The `position` vector will then be interpreted as meter offsets from this anchor point.
