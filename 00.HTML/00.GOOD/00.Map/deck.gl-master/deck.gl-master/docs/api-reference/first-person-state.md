# FirstPersonState Class (Experimental)

## Constructor

Viewport arguments

* `width` - Width of viewport
* `height` - Height of viewport

Position and orientation

* `position` - typically in meters from anchor point
* `direction`
* `bearing` - Rotation around y axis
* `pitch` - Rotation around x axis

Geospatial "anchor"

* `longitude`
* `latitude`
* `zoom`
* `syncBearing` = true, // Whether to lock bearing to direction

Constraints - simple movement limit

* `bounds` - Bounding box of the world, in the shape of {minX, maxX, minY, maxY, minZ, maxZ}

Internal Interaction states, required to calculate change during transform

* `startPanEventPosition` - Model state when the pan operation first started
* `startPanPosition` - Model state when the pan operation first started

* `startRotateCenter` - Model state when the rotate operation first started
* `startRotateViewport` - Model state when the rotate operation first started

* `startZoomPos` - Model state when the zoom operation first started
* `startZoom` - Model state when the zoom operation first started


## Methods

Implements a viewState:

##### `getViewportProps()`

##### `getInteractiveState()`

##### `panStart({pos})`

Start panning

`pos` (`[Number, Number]`) - position on screen where the pointer grabs

##### `pan({pos, startPos})`

Pan

`pos` (`[Number, Number]`) - position on screen where the pointer is

`startPos` (`[Number, Number], optional`) - where the pointer grabbed at

  the start of the operation. Must be supplied of `panStart()` was not called

##### `panEnd()`

End panning

Must call if `panStart()` was called

##### `rotateStart({pos})`

Start rotating

`pos` (`[Number, Number]`) - position on screen where the center is

##### `rotate({deltaScaleX, deltaScaleY})`

Rotate

`deltaScaleX` (`Number`) - a number between [-1, 1] specifying the

  change to bearing.

`deltaScaleY` (`Number`) - a number between [-1, 1] specifying the

  change to pitch. -1 sets to minPitch and 1 sets to maxPitch.


##### `rotateEnd()`

End rotating

Must call if `rotateStart()` was called

##### `zoomStart({pos})`

Start zooming

@param {[Number, Number]} pos - position on screen where the center is

##### `zoom({pos, startPos, scale})`

Zoom

`pos` (`[Number, Number]`) - position on screen where the current center is

`startPos` (`[Number, Number]`) - the center position at

  the start of the operation. Must be supplied of `zoomStart()` was not called

`scale` (`Number`) - a number between [0, 1] specifying the accumulated

  relative scale.
    assert(scale > 0, '`scale` must be a positive number')

##### `zoomEnd()`

End zooming

Must call if `zoomStart()` was called

##### `moveLeft()`

##### `moveRight()`

##### `moveForward()`

##### `moveBackward()`

##### `zoomIn()`

##### `zoomOut()`
