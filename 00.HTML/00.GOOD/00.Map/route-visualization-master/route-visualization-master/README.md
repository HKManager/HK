> Visualizing trips from the SF Bay Area from the Chffr app.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* If you want to use MongoDB / the MERN stack, you must have MongoDB installed.
    * Uncomment the dispatch for fetchRoutes in Map.js
    * In _renderLayers(), data: test should be replaced with routes.routes

```bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
npm run client-install

# If you are running this for the MERN stack
npm run build-db

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```
